# ML Model Development and Deployment Branching Strategy

## Branch Types

### 1. Main Branch (`main`)
- Contains production-ready code
- All models deployed to production come from this branch
- Protected branch - requires pull request and approvals
- Tagged with version numbers for releases

### 2. Development Branch (`develop`)
- Main integration branch for feature development
- Contains latest development code
- Models are trained and evaluated here
- Automated tests and validations run on this branch

### 3. Feature Branches (`feature/*`)
- Created for new features or model improvements
- Branch naming: `feature/model-architecture-improvement`
- Examples:
  - `feature/add-feature-engineering`
  - `feature/improve-hyperparameter-tuning`
  - `feature/add-new-model-type`

### 4. Release Branches (`release/*`)
- Created when preparing a new model version for production
- Branch naming: `release/v1.2.0`
- Used for final testing and validation
- Only bug fixes are allowed in these branches

### 5. Hotfix Branches (`hotfix/*`)
- Created to fix critical issues in production
- Branch naming: `hotfix/fix-prediction-bug`
- Merged directly into both `main` and `develop`

## Workflow

1. **Feature Development**
   ```
   develop -> feature/new-feature -> develop
   ```
   - Create feature branch from `develop`
   - Develop and test new features
   - Create PR to merge back into `develop`

2. **Model Training & Validation**
   ```
   develop -> release/v1.2.0 -> main
   ```
   - Train models on `develop`
   - Create release branch for final validation
   - Merge to `main` when ready for production

3. **Emergency Fixes**
   ```
   main -> hotfix/critical-fix -> main + develop
   ```
   - Create hotfix branch from `main`
   - Fix the issue and test
   - Merge to both `main` and `develop`

## Version Control Best Practices

1. **Commit Messages**
   - Use descriptive commit messages
   - Format: `[type]: Brief description`
   - Types: `model`, `data`, `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `test`
   - Example: `[model]: Improve feature importance calculation`

2. **Pull Requests**
   - Require code review from at least one team member
   - Include model performance metrics
   - Update documentation
   - Pass all automated tests

3. **Model Versioning**
   - Use semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
   - Tag releases in git
   - Document model changes and performance metrics

## CI/CD Integration

1. **Feature Branches**
   - Run linting and unit tests
   - Run quick model validation

2. **Develop Branch**
   - Run full model training
   - Run integration tests
   - Generate performance reports

3. **Release Branches**
   - Run extensive model validation
   - Generate deployment artifacts
   - Update documentation

4. **Main Branch**
   - Deploy model to staging
   - Run smoke tests
   - Deploy to production

## Model Artifacts

1. **Version Control**
   - Model weights stored in DVC
   - Training data versions tracked
   - Hyperparameters logged in MLflow

2. **Documentation**
   - Model cards for each version
   - Performance metrics history
   - Dataset evolution tracking
